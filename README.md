# Deep Learning-Based Approaches for Human Pose Estimation in Interdisciplinary Physics Applications

## Overview
This repository provides the implementation of a robust and accurate human pose estimation framework designed for use across interdisciplinary physics domains. Our approach combines multi-scale spatio-temporal deep learning techniques with advanced refinement strategies to address challenges in real-world pose estimation, such as occlusion, scale variation, and temporal inconsistency.

## Project Name Suggestion
**PosePhysics** — A concise and meaningful name representing the integration of pose estimation and physics applications.

## Key Components

### 1. Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Pose Network (HSTPN)
- Leverages **multi-scale feature fusion**.
- Employs **attention mechanisms** to capture both global and fine-grained contextual information.
- Handles occlusions and scale variations effectively.

### 2. Adaptive Pose Refinement Strategy (APRS)
- Iteratively refines keypoint predictions.
- Uses **spatial, temporal, and domain-specific constraints**.
- Enhances prediction robustness and consistency across video sequences.

## Motivation
Human pose estimation plays a pivotal role in applications such as:
- **Biomechanics and movement analysis**
- **Sports performance assessment**
- **Robotics and control systems**
- **Augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) interfaces**

However, generalizing to unconstrained, real-world settings remains a significant challenge. Our solution addresses these issues with an adaptive, attention-enhanced deep learning framework.

## Features

- ✅ Accurate keypoint localization in both 2D and 3D space
- ✅ Superior performance in unconstrained environments
- ✅ Real-time capability with high computational efficiency
- ✅ Cross-domain applicability (e.g., physics, sports, robotics)
